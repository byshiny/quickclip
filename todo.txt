Minimum requirements:
Paste buffer storage
Right click to cycle through
Warning about keyboard shortcuts
Packaging
Quit unexpectedly warning`
Dialog box opening position
Externalize all position data
Doing something about resetting when you turn off the computer or if the computer crashes... I/O

Idiot proofing myself:

1. I need to go figure out how to convert this stupid keyset issue, and see if it maps.
2. Also need to check out if this keyset mapping will be consistent across all backgrounds.

#Global shortcuts are already defined will not register.

You need to do a lot of clean up. Thread clean up.
How the fuck are you going to package this? What about the configuration? Do you need a UI for this.
