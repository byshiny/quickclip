Minimum requirements:
0. I need a visual signal in the trey to say that the countdown for buffer cycling has started....
Or even do a redesign??? 
1. Paste buffer external storage
2. Right click to cycle through
3. cut support
4. Instructions on how to disable "funk" - http://www.mactricksandtips.com/2008/07/switch-off-annoying-system-sounds.html
5. Put exact dependencies to avoid breakage in package.json
//need to add zero error handling - nothing inside
6. Investigate how to enable logging and debug mode
7. Apply cut functionality
Warning about keyboard shortcuts
3. Packaging
4. OS Detection
5. Paymeium, limit size of shortcutKeys map
6. Logging
7. CARE: Changing the format of the save configs will change the save state!!!!
Quit unexpectedly warning(DONE)
Dialog box opening position
Externalize all position data
Doing something about resetting when you turn off the computer or if the computer crashes... I/O

Idiot proofing myself:

1. I need to go figure out how to convert this stupid keyset issue, and see if it maps.
2. Also need to check out if this keyset mapping will be consistent across all backgrounds.

#Global shortcuts are already defined will not register.

You need to do a lot of clean up. Thread clean up.

2. Some electron features are not supported  - i.e. out of focus, keycodes, etc


Test before deployment:

Check if mouse buffer can be launched more than once
test suite:
one
two
three
four
five
test that all buffers are working correctly
