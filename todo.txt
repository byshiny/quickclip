Minimum requirements:
Paste buffer storage
Right click to cycle through
Warning about keyboard shortcuts
Packaging

Dialog box opening position
Externalize all position data


Idiot proofing myself:

1. I need to go figure out how to convert this stupid keyset issue, and see if it maps.
2. Also need to check out if this keyset mapping will be consistent across all backgrounds.

#Global shortcuts are already defined will not register.

You need to do a lot of clean up. Thread clean up.
How the fuck are you going to package this? What about the configuration? Do you need a UI for this.
